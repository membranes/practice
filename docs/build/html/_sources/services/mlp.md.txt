<br>

In collaboration with the business team, please preliminarily assess _business machine learning project_ service requests by

<ul class="special">
    <li>Using the upcoming elicitation hub back-end of the Scottish Artificial Intelligence Register; for eliciting 
project scope, details.</li>
    <li>Conducting a technological feasibility & economic viability assessment, using the project scope details.</li>
</ul>

The team's _services launch_ blog, or a later blog, will include an introduction to the elicitation hub; and an 
introduction to feasibility/viability assessments.

<br>

A key aspect of the design details elicitation is identifying the groups or people or partners that will be responsible for 
different parts of the project, and the costs thereof.  If feasible the design details will indicate whether the data 
science team will be delivering any part of the project, or whether it will oversee the project.  The data science 
team must carefully consider its current commitments before making a prospective commitment.
