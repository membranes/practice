# Scala

<br>

Scala has a <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/" target="_blank">style guide</a>, and it is the team's style 
reference.  Take note of the naming conventions.  The names of classes, objects, methods, etc., are either pascal case, also known as
upper camel case, camel case, or lower case; no names with underscores, please.
