These pages continuously outline the data science team's operating principles vis-Ã -vis, e.g.,

<ul class="special">
    <li>Collaborating with business teams addressing business problems; if machine learning modelling is beneficial.</li>
    <li>Machine learning algorithms inquiries</li>
    <li>The traceability, security, auditability, reproducibility, etc., of all products and services.</li>
    
</ul>

<br>

Within the unit, data science is about addressing business, e.g., public services, problems.  It is not about technology or 
data.  These pages ensure that team:

* **Business/Public Problem**. Focuses on projects that (a) address a business problem, (b) have an unambiguous problem 
statement, \(c\) have a deployment goal, (d) a machine learning model prediction/forecast/diagnostic aim, (e) are 
  technologically feasible and 
economically viable.

* **Modelling**. Develops models in-line with model/solution development best practices, including in-depth collaborations 
with domain experts, which ensures the development of well-informed models.

* **Machine Learning Product/System**. Designs, develops, and/or deploys solutions that are (a) in-line with software 
engineering, i.e., programming, best practices, (b) secure, \(c\) available, reliable, maintainable, and resilient.

* **Operations**. Operates within a secure and productive settings, and offers efficient, i.e., quick & effective, data
science consulting services.
