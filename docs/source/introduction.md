These pages will be updated continuously because

* The technologies in the fields of machine learning and data are advancing continuously, which means solution patterns must evolve accordingly; for productivity and software/code libraries vulnerabilities reasons.

* The data science team will be addressing an unknown range of problems that are addressable via a variety of artificial intelligence algorithms for a variety of business problems, each requiring a distinct design & deployment solution pattern. Hence, the team will continuous explore/test a variety solution architectures.

<br>

Within the unit, data science is about addressing business or public problems.  It is not about technology or data.  
These pages ensure that team:

**Business/Public Problem**. Focuses on projects that (a) address a business or public problem, (b) have an unambiguous problem statement alongside a
machine learning model aim, (c) are technologically feasible and economically viable.

**Modelling**. Develops models in-line with model/solution development best practices, including in-depth collaborations with domain
experts, which ensures the development of well-informed models.

**Machine Learning Product/System**. Designs, develops, and/or deploys solutions that are (a) in-line with software engineering, i.e., programming, best
practices, (b) secure, (c) available, reliable, maintainable, and resilient.

**Operations**. Operates within a secure and productive settings, and offers efficient, i.e., quick & effective, data
science consulting services.
