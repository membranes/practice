Steps:

<ul class="special">
    <li>The machine learning design, project scope, details: UPCOMING &rarr; A link to an elicitation hub via the Scottish 
Artificial Intelligence Register + JIRA.</li>
    <li>Prospective machine learning project feasibility/viability assessment via the design details.</li>
</ul>

A key aspect of the design details elicitation is identifying the groups or people or partners that will be responsible for 
different parts of the project, and the costs thereof.  If feasible the design details will indicate whether the data 
science team will be delivering any part of the project, or whether it will oversee the project.  The data science 
team must carefully consider its current commitments before making a prospective commitment; a prospective commitment 
becomes a commitment if the prospective project is feasible.
