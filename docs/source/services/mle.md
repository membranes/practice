Machine Learning Engineering Services
=====================================

<br>

```{admonition} Update
:class: margin
In progress.
```

<br>

Please address service requests via the upcoming JIRA Service Management hub.  The team's services
launch blog will include an introduction to the hub.  Before proceeding with a machine learning engineering service 
ascertain that it is a component of an in-progress project:

> That (a) addresses a business problem, (b) has an unambiguous problem statement, (c) has a deployment goal, (d) has a 
> machine learning model prediction/forecast/diagnostic aim, (e) is technologically feasible and economically viable.

Additionally, rigorously evaluate

* Model requirements
* Team capacity

Each machine learning engineering project must have its own JIRA Project.
